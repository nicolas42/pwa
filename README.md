A Progressive Web App (PWA) is a type of web application that offers an app-like experience directly through a web browser. PWAs are designed to be fast, reliable, and engaging, combining the best of websites and mobile apps. Here are the key features:

Installable: Users can add PWAs to their home screen without going through an app store.
Offline Access: They can work offline or with poor internet connectivity through caching.
Responsive: They adapt to any screen size (mobile, tablet, desktop).
Push Notifications: They can send notifications like native apps.
Secure: PWAs are served over HTTPS, ensuring secure communications.
They provide a seamless user experience by integrating features traditionally found in native apps.
